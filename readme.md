## The Australian Open Radar Science School

Welcome to the Australian Open Science School. To be held for the first time on the 13th of November 2018 at Monash 
University.

This School, open to all and offered free of charge is motivated by:
 * The opening of the Australian radar archive to the public for scientific use.
 * The Dual polarimetric upgrade of the Australian radar network.
 * The explosion in open source packages for working with radar data.
 * The Third Australian Radar workshop to be held following the School.

This workshop will be "Bring Your Own Device". Users should have the ability to configure and load software specifically
the Anaconda Python Distribution. A beginners level of Python will optimize the knowledge gained from the course. 

The workshop will be on the Clayton Campus of Monash. The exact venue will be determined when we have numbers
